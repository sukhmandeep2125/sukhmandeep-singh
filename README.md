This project addresses the challenge of removing noise from digital images using a simple mean filter algorithm. The goal is to develop an effective image denoising pipeline from scratch using Python and NumPy, without relying on high-level APIs. The process involves reading an image, applying the mean filter to reduce noise, and then saving and displaying the denoised image. This foundational project not only demonstrates basic image processing techniques but also sets the stage for exploring more advanced denoising methods in the future.
